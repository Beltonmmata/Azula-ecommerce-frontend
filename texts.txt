  

  <p>
  
   i have been creating this single page vanillar js
    application that has routes between pages , it has a single 
    html page with the app element that the javascript page component is
     injected to through the main.js file that has the routes, the page component 
     and other reusable small component that creates the route has are objects with render() and reRender()
      metjodes........but i have been facing this problem
       in my application whire by when the user interacts by events
        eg clicks and submit the components are not rerendered and this 
        creates a bad user experience. i have created this code   to solve
         the problem so that i can call it in trhe event listener
   
    attached to the element clicked and parse the 
    component affected as a parssametor but seems not to work
  <p>
